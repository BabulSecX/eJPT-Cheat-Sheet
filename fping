fping - An improved ping tool
https://fping.org/

Linux tool which is an improved version of the ping utility:


fping -a -g -s -q $ipRange
fping -agsq $ipRange
# -a: forces the tool to show only alive hosts.
# -g: tells the tool we want to perform a ping sweep instead of a standard ping.
# -s: prints stats at the end of the scan
# -q: not to show per-target results
Also you can use the CIDR notation:


fping -a -g 10.54.12.0/24
fping -a -g 10.54.12.0 10.54.12.255
